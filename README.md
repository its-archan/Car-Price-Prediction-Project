![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/max/5752/1*5dq_1hnqkboZTcKFfwbO9A.png "a title")

## Overview

In this project, we will use what we've learned about Linear Regression, Random Forest and 
different regression algorithms for prediction. 
Several models will be trained to predict the prices of used cars listed in various marketplaces. 
We will compare these results and choose the optimum model.
